# RSA_ASP
## Project Description

Since our lives are more depending of online exchange, Safer method or environment of exchange are in demand.
This is why I decided to work on the RSA Algorithm for my senior project. In this project, we will be using public,
and private keys to encrypt, and decrypt a message. To produce these keys we will be working with some prime numbers, and math formulas.

This project will be implemented in Python languages, so a proper platform or IDE that can run py files will be needed, such as Spyder, VisualCode, anaconda etc.
