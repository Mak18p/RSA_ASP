# RSA_ASP
## Project Description

Since our lives are more depending of online exchange, Safer method or environment of exchange are in demand.
This is why I decided to work on the RSA Algorithm for my senior project. In this project, we will be using public,
and private keys to encrypt, and decrypt a message. To produce these keys we will be working with some prime numbers, and math formulas.

This project will be implemented in Python languages, so a proper platform or IDE that can run py files will be needed, such as Spyder, VisualCode, anaconda etc.

## Getting Started 
 To get started we begin with two prime numbers P and Q, the bigger they are the more secure is the encryption, but the longer it will take to process.
 Using the numbers, we will calculate n = P*Q, and T = phi = (P-1)*(Q-1). Next, we can provide a prime number as public key (e), 
 but it must be smaller than T, and be co-primes of T and n
